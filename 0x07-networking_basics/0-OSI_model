OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is a conceptual model that describes the functions of a telecommunication system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. It is organized into seven layers, each responsible for specific tasks:

Physical Layer: Deals with physical connections and transmission of raw data over a communication channel.
Data Link Layer: Handles data framing, error detection, and correction within the network.
Network Layer: Manages routing, addressing, and logical transmission of data packets across networks.
Transport Layer: Ensures reliable end-to-end communication, segmenting data, and managing flow control.
Session Layer: Establishes, maintains, and synchronizes communication sessions between devices.
Presentation Layer: Translates, encrypts, or compresses data into a format suitable for transmission.
Application Layer: Provides network services directly to end-users and application processes.
The OSI model is organized from the lowest level (Physical Layer) to the highest level (Application Layer), with each layer building upon the functionalities of the lower layers.
